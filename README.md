# CS520 Theory of Programming Languages, Fall 2024, KAIST 

This is a webpage of the course "CS520 Theory of Programming Languages", which is offered at the KAIST CS department in the fall of 2024. The webpage will contain links to course-related materials and announcements.

CS520 is an advanced graduate-level course on the theories of programming languages. Its goal is to expose students to rigorous mathematical foundations for programming languages and systems, and mathematical techniques for formally reasoning about  programs written in those languages. The course will largely follow Reynolds's textbook "Theories of Programming Languages", which provides good mathematical treatment of a wide range of programming constructs through axiomatic, denotational, and operational semantics. 

The prerequisite of the course is CS320, the undergraduate-level programming-language course offered at KAIST, or a similar course. The course will be heavy in math, and we expect students to be comfortable with doing and reading rigorous mathematical proofs. 

## 1. Important Announcements

#### [27 August] Q&A and use of a LLM.

We strongly recommend students to ask questions in KLMS, instead of in github, if they have any. This would help fellow students to access those questions and corresponding answers more easily. It would also help TAs and the lecture not to miss those questions.

We do not permit students to ask homework questions directly to ChatGPT, Gemini, or other LLMs. Doing so would be regarded as the violation of the honour code. However, students can use LLMs to get help for their study, for instance, using CoPilot to solve LaTeX typesetting issues and asking ChatGPT to get an overview of a concept or a technique covered in the course or encountered in your group project. If a student or a project group gets help from LLMs for an assignment, such as a project report, the student or the group should do the following two things:

1. In a submission, the student or the project group should explain how and where LLMs are used.
2. LLMs are well-known to give false information. Ensuring correctness is the responsibility of the student or the project group.

#### [August 27] Policy for handling late submissions.

We will adopt the following scheme for handling late submissions for all types of assignments, including homework assignments. The scheme assumes that the total marks are 100.

1. <= One day late (by the midnight of the next day): -10
2. <= Two days late: -20
3. <= Three days late: -30
4. <= Four days late: -40
5. More than four days late: -100.

#### [August 27] Honour code.

We adopt a very strict policy for handling dishonest behaviours. If a student is found to copy answers from peers or other sources in her or his submission for any assignment, he or she will get F.

We also handle the case of plagiarism strictly. Plagiarism means that students copy texts from other sources in their reports. They shouldn't do it. If students have to use texts from other sources, they have to rephrase the texts in their own words and state the source of the texts explicitly. Ideally, students' write-ups should mostly consist of the students' own phrases and expressions, and use such borrowed and rephrased sentences only when doing so is absolutely needed; if a large part of the report is just a eries of rephrases of existing texts, the report won't get good marks. Copying texts from other sources is an instance of plagiarism, and if it happens to an academic, it can destroy his or her research career. If a report of a student or a project group is found to plagiarise, the student or everyone in the group will get F.

## 8. Study Materials

We will mainly follow Reynolds's book, but study the materials appearing in Chapters 8 and 10 of Tennent's book.

* Main Textbook 1 : [Theories of Programming Languages, John C Reynolds](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/theories-of-programming-languages/19530A88F3471B2A7D9891770B21DAF9), Cambridge University Press, 1998. 
* Main Textbook 2 : Semantics of Programming Languages, Robert D. Tennent, Prentice Hall, 1991. Chapters 8 and 10 only.

In addition to the two books above, the following books will have further information about the topics covered in the course. In particular, Gunter's book goes deep into the domain theory, and Pierce's book into the type theory.

* Auxiliary Textbook 1 : [Practical Foundations for Programming Languages](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl/2nded.pdf), Second Edition, Robert Harper, Cambridge University Press, 2016.
* Auxiliary Textbook 2 : Semantics of Programming Languages: Structures and Techniques, Carl A. Gunter, MIT Press, 1992.
* Auxiliary Textbook 3 : Types and Programming Languages, Benjamin C. Pierce, MIT Press, 2002.
* Auxiliary Textbook 4 : Formal Semantics of Programming Languages: an Introduction, Glynn Winskel, MIT Press, 1993.

The following classic papers or their recent reprints contain deep insight into some of topics that we study throughout the course.
